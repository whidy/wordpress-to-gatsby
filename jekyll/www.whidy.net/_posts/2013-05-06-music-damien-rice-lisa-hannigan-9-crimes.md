歌名: **9 Crimes**

歌手: **Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan**

专辑: **9**

歌词:

Lisa Hannigan:
Leave me out with the waste.
视我如草履，弃我于荒野
This is not what I do.
本非我所愿，所行莫奈何。
It's the wrong kind of place.
沦落于此境，回首不堪言。
To be thinking of you.
思汝如满月，思汝已决堤。

<!-- more -->

It's the wrong time for somebody new
君不同在时，纵情强欢颜。
It's a small crime, and I've got no excuse
此罪似无端，欲辩无所藉。
Is that alright?
此情对错否，欲辨已忘言。
Give my gun away when it's loaded.
痛不欲生时，莫若生死许。
Is that alright?
此情对错否，欲辨已忘言。
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
若不生死与，我又怎解脱。
Is that alright?
此情对错否，欲辨已忘言。
Give my gun away when it's loaded.
痛不欲生时，莫若生死许。
Is that alright with you?
君心似明月，相守却成咎。

Damien Rice:
Leave me out with the waste.
视我如草履，弃我于荒野
This is not what I do.
本非我所愿，所行莫奈何。
It's the wrong kind of place.
沦落于此境，回首不堪言。
To be cheating on you.
是爱在说谎，情动已成殇。
It's the wrong time. She's pulling me through.
君为何不在？她诱我狂欢。
It's a small crime, and I've got no excuse
此罪似无端，欲辩无所藉。

Damien & Lisa:
Is that alright?
此情对错否，欲辨已忘言。
Give my gun away when it's loaded. (Lisa: Is that alright?)
痛不欲生时，莫若生死许。
Is that alright?
此情对错否，欲辨已忘言。
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it. (Lisa: Is that alright?)
若不生死与，我又怎解脱。
Is that alright?
此情对错否，欲辨已忘言。
Give my gun away when it's loaded. (Lisa: Is that alright?)
痛不欲生时，莫若生死许。
Is that alright with you?
君心似明月，相守却成咎。

Is that alright with you?
君心似明月，相守却成咎。
No…
罪莫奈何兮，毋宁自取咎

突然对爱尔兰的音乐了有了莫名的好感...就这样喜欢上了.
