歌名: **The Harder Ships Of The World**

歌手: **Keren Ann**

专辑: **Keren Ann**

歌词:

Tell me my friend
Do you still break the hearts?
Do you still put the crowds under your spell?
I've lived in a trial
Some invisible storm
Now I'm back in the land, and I miss you as hell

I see roads of light
Close to me, close to me
I'm riding on...<!-- more -->

We sail the harder ships of the world
To the greater grips of the land
And we get closer to nowhere

You know we ran to the shores
And lost in the race
But they're all standing tall, humble and brave
Then I had dreams of you here
You were rockin' the place
Begging to save what's left to save

I hear voices sing
Close to me, close to me
I'm riding on...

We sail the harder ships of the worlds
To the greater grips of the land
And we get closer to nowhere

We sail the harder ships of the world
To the greater grips of the land
And we get closer to nowhere

We sail the harder ships of the world
To the greater grips of the land
To the further lights of the soul
The harder ships of the world
The harder ships of the world
The harder ships of the world

非常抒情的一首歌曲
