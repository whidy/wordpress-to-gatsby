歌名: **I'm Yours**

歌手: **Jason Mraz**

专辑: **We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things**

歌词:

Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you’re so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I’m trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I’ll be giving it my bestest
And nothing’s going to stop me
But divine intervention
I reckon it’s again my turn
To win some or learn some
But I won’t hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait
I’m yours

<!-- more -->

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you’re free
Look into your heart
And you’ll find love love love love
Listen to the music
Of the moment people, dance and sing
We’re just one big family
And it’s our God-forsaken
Right to be loved loved loved loved loved
So I won’t hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm sure
There’s no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate
I’m yours

D-d-do do you but do you d-d-do
But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I’ve been spending way too long
Checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards
Just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is
There ain’t no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities
And just go with the seasons
It’s what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
But I won’t hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait
I’m yours
And open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you’re free
Look into your heart
And you’ll find that the sky is yours
So please don’t please don’t please don’t
There’s no need to complicate
Cause our time is short
This is this is this is our fate
I’m yours
