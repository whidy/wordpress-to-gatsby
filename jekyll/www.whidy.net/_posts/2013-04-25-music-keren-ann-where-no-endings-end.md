歌名: **Where No Endings End**

歌手: **Keren Ann**

专辑: **Keren Ann**

歌词:

Send me off shore
It's a cold blooded war
I can't win
I give in
I give in

In the field of my fight
We can wonder all night
Why we have
All this love
All this love

<!-- more -->

You and I, we were drawn
In the break of the dawn
With the boreal wind
But we can't change the world
No we can't change the world
It's been done
By someone
Long ago

Send me off shore
There's a bright semaphore
Calling in
Every wind
Every wind

In the loop of my game
There's a whole life to blame
It's been done
But we won
What we won

You and I, we both run
With a unloaded gun
For the same piece of land
Where no endings end
But we can't change the world
No we can't change the world
It's been done
By someone
Long ago

You and I, we both run
With a unloaded gun
For the same piece of land
Where no endings end
But we can't change the world
No we can't change the world
It's been done
By someone
Long ago

Send me off shore
She's a cold blooded war
I can't win
I give in
I give in

再一次推荐她的另一曲...至于情感,自己去体会咯~
