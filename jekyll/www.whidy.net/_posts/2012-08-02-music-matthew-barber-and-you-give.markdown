歌名: **And You Give**

歌手: **Matthew Barber**

专辑: **Ghost notes**

歌词:

It started out two winters past
Time stood still we were moving too fast
You ran away April, May and June
When you came back I was over the moon

I was high, I was high over the moon
You were there, you were there midnight and noon oh
Bring it back, bring it back
We started too soon
I was high, I was high over the moon oh oh

Then came fall babe and we fell hard
Bruised our bodies, skinned our knees and our hearts
Then I got sick yeah but no one could tell
Now I drink your love drink right from the well

And it's good and its good right from the well
Wanna taste, wanna touch, wanna see and smell oh
And it feels like it feels, heals me so well
Wanna drink, wanna drink right from the well oh oh

Now here I sit in my burning cell
Summer sun beating hotter than hell
I need your love like the air I breath
I need it more than you could ever believe

And you give and you give, give it to me
And you give and you give all that I need oh
And I take and I take, blood that you bleed
And you give and you give, give it to me oh

And you give and you give, give it to me
And you give and you give all that I need oh
And I take and I take, blood that you bleed
And you give and you give, give it to me oh

音乐轻松,优美...另外也推荐Where the river bends :D
