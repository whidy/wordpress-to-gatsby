歌名: **The Color Of You**

歌手: **Lisa Ekdahl**

专辑: **Heaven Earth and Beyond**

歌词:

Blue is the color of love
When your lover has gone from you
Your heart is filled with longing to have new
What came once from others
When you open your heart for two
But now it's true and you realize
What illusion can do
If you close your eyes
But the dreaming is over now

So blue is the color of you
When you're waiting for someone who
Will always make your dreams come true
But now it's true and you realize
What illusion can do
If you close your eyes
But the dreaming is over now
So blue is the color of you
When you're waiting for someone who
Will always make your dreams come true
