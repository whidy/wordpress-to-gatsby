歌名: **Rolling In The Deep**

词曲: **Adele**

演唱: **Adele**

歌词:

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your sheet bare

See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bring me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all(you're gonna wish you,never had met me)
Rolling in the deep(tears are gonna fall,rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand(you're gonna wish you.never had met me)
And you played it
To the beat

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you, and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all(you're gonna wish you,never had met me)
Rolling in the deep(tears are gonna fall,rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand(you're gonna wish you.never had met me)
And you played it(tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
To the beat

could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it
With a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sown

We could have had it all
We could have had it all
It all, it all it all,
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it,to played it, to played it
to played it
To the beat
